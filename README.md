practising forms styling and aligining elements in weird positions to understand elemet aliging I have always stuggled to make a proper form for any kind of project not because 
I can't but it just felt sub-optimal whenever I did it on my own so practising the methods gives me a better understanding on how to do better for this kinda stuff. 
Moving forward I will try improve on the projects that have already been created rather than creating new ones.
